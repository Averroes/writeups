# corrupt transmission (forensic Â· 50 pt)

We intercepted this image, but it must have gotten corrupted during the transmission. Can you try and fix it?

the .PNG file seems to be corrupt

With PNGCHECK : 

```
root@kali:~/Bureau# pngcheck -v corrupt_92cee405924ad39fb513e3ef910699b79bb6d45cc5046c051eb9aab3546e22c3.png 
File: corrupt_92cee405924ad39fb513e3ef910699b79bb6d45cc5046c051eb9aab3546e22c3.png (469363 bytes)
  File is CORRUPTED.  It seems to have suffered EOL conversion.
  It was probably transmitted in text mode.
```


The header of the PNG file has been modified in his first 8 octets has we can see with :  
```
root@kali:~/Bureau# xxd -l8 corrupt_92cee405924ad39fb513e3ef910699b79bb6d45cc5046c051eb9aab3546e22c3.png 
0000000: 9050 4e47 0e1a 0a1b  
```


A png normal header is : 89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A.

If we correct the header, the picture show us the flag :)
