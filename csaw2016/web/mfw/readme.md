# mfw / My first web server

In this challenge, we had as hint that there was PHP, GIT & bootstrap.

So GIT was the first hint: 

```
  challenge/.git/ 
```

Found all objects but was unable to git clone the repository.

Instead, I downloaded each file in the .git repository and used the 

```
  git checkout -- index.php templates/*
```

to get all the files back.
