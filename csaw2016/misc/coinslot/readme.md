# Coinslot

In this challenge, the goal was to give the correct amount of each kind of piece :

- 10'000
- 5'000
- 1'000
- 500
- 100
- 50
- 20
- 10
- 5
- 1
- 0.5
- 0.25
- 0.10
- 0.05
- 0.01

Since python calculation with float sux so much, I multiplied by 100.

You had to connect to a port, and give the good amount of each, 400 times in a row and received a "correct" message

After this, flag was shown. Hopefully I catched this message and didn't need to launch the full test again.
