# North Korea - fucking russian programmers 

There was a strange page written in russian.

So google translate was my friend, you had to login with a user and then parse a bunch of (),[],{} to make them feel complete and find their significant other.

The goal was, for each opening (,[,{ to have a closing ),],}, in the correct order. So I used the parseparenthesis script to do the job, and copy/pasted the result in the page, giving me the flag!
