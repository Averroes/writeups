# Mozambique 1magePr1son

For this chall, we got a well know OS X wallpaper, we can observe that there is strange pixels every 25 pixels 

I crop the image to keep only the strange pixels in, it gave me an 1513*1523 png

I scripted to keep only thoses pixels and write it into a new image (see getflag.py)

Resulting image ![flag](./outgrid.png)
