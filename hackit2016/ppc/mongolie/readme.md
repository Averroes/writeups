# Mongolie

In this challenge, the goal was to answer 100 times on the question 

C = A ^ B

At first I was like "Why not use C ^ 1", but then I failed to submit it (instructions not obvious on how to submit A and B). 

So I decided to find a way to factorize it, what is done luckily by factordb.com.

I found out that way that you had to send it with "A B" (A, space B)

The script helped me request factordb then sending the result to the challenge's server.

After 100 correct results, it gave me the flag !
